# AssultCube-Internal

Here is a assult cube hack (internal) with an external GUI that uses an IPC to send data, I originally made this external GUI because i was too lazy to hook the mouse function
and make internal GUI, the menu has shitty code and is sloppy but the internal itself is somewhat solid, there are many ways this code could be improved and optimized however I do not have
the time and energy to make this better at the moment

everything is up to date for assult cube 1.3.0.2

Making this taught me a lot about rendering and internal cheats, it was a fun project, do not paste pls (bad code)

it does have an injector but im pretty sure its leaking a handle because i forgot to close that somewhere lol
